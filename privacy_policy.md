# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

VIM respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect or you may provide when you download, install, register with, access or use the App and VIM’s practices for collecting, using, disclosing, and protecting that information. This Privacy Policy only applies to information we collect in the App, in e-mail, SMS text, and other electronic communications sent through or in connection with the App. To be clear, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that we collect off-line or on any other VIM apps or websites, including websites you may access through the App, or to information that you provide to, or that is otherwise collected by, any third party. (Please review such third parties’ and our other websites’ and apps’ privacy policies.)

If, after you have reviewed this Privacy Policy carefully, you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, register with or use the App. By downloading, registering with or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be changed by VIM from time to time. Your continued use of the App after we change this Privacy Policy is deemed to result in your acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.

Children under 13 Years of Age: The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at support@vimaec.com.

Non-United States Persons: VIM does not operate facilities outside the United States. The App and VIM’s related applications and website are hosted in the United States and are not intended for non-United States persons. VIM processes data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and with applicable law in the United States. Any personal information about non-United States persons (including persons resident in the European Union (“EU”) and considered EU data subjects) provided via the App is processed in the United States by VIM or by a third party acting on behalf of VIM. In certain countries outside the United States, individuals are entitled to the right to access, correct, transmit, restrict, delete and object to processing of the personal information we have collected, and may also be entitled to withdraw consent to processing of personal information. When you provide personal information to VIM through the App, you consent to the processing of your information in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are an EU data subject, at any time you wish to know what data we process about you, you can request to gain access to that information by making a request of support@vimaec.com, and VIM will provide you with reasonable opportunities to gain access to and update or delete your information. If you are an EU data subject, you have certain other rights with respect to your information provided to VIM – you can make any requests with respect to those rights by e-mail to support@vimaec.com.

Personal Information VIM Collects: Certain areas of VIM’s website and social media pages may require individuals to register and/or create an account to enable access to content and offers. Information that individuals opt to provide to VIM in connection with registration may include name, date of birth, home address or ZIP code, e-mail address, phone number and preferred VIM location. VIM collects such information as part of the registration process. VIM may also use a variety of technologies to collect information directly from individuals, including cookies and web beacons, and may collect information provided by the individual’s web browser, such as internet protocol address and operating system. Our web server uses an extended log file format which captures: date and time of visit, referring address (location from which a visitor comes to a VIM website), types of computing devices and Internet browsers, and visitors’ IP addresses. (Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP address, for identification purposes). The log file does not capture a visitor’s email address.

Removal of cookies from computing devices: Individuals may remove cookies their computing devices’ memories, including cookies placed by or through the use of the VIM website or social media pages. Please check with the applicable browser provider for more information on removing cookies.

Nature of VIM’s Use of Information Collected: The information collected by VIM through this App, on its websites and through its social media pages is used to improve the services we offer, to improve the website and social media content we provide, to contact customers regarding updates to such content and for other marketing purposes, including targeted marketing of offers related to our product offerings.

VIM Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information with Others: Most of the information collected by VIM is statistical data that is not capable of identifying a particular individual (Anonymous Data). However, the information collected by VIM may include information that, on its own or together with other information, may allow an individual to be personally identified (PII). If an individual does not wish for VIM to share information with others as described in this Privacy Policy, such individual may choose not to interact with VIM’s website or social media pages. In all instances, VIM endeavors to design and implement its practices and policies to abide by applicable law and to reasonably secure and protect information we collect from individuals against unauthorized disclosure and third-party access. In some cases, VIM may disclose PII to third parties, such as:

- Our service providers: We contract with companies who help with parts of our business operations. We require that our service providers only use PII in connection with the services they perform for us, including services performed in fulfilling the purpose for which an individual provided PII.

- Service providers to our advertisers: Our advertisers may contract with companies who handle data (such as advertisers’ customer lists) for them.

- Our subsidiaries and related companies: Our affiliates may assist VIM in providing and marketing its services to the public,including through the use and analysis of information we collect from individuals.

## Data Security

VIM has implemented measures designed to secure personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. The safety and security of personal information also depends on individual conduct – where VIM has given individuals access to certain parts of its website or social media pages through passwords and the like, such individuals are responsible for keeping such access information confidential. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not fully secure, and although VIM endeavors to protect personal information against unauthorized access or distribution, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information transmitted to VIM’s website or social media pages, and such transmission of personal information is at the individual’s own risk.
