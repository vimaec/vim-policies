### Logging & Monitoring
Production infrastructure shall produce detailed logs, including:
- User log-in and log-out events.

### Control of Operational Software
The installation of software on production systems shall follow documented change management requirements.

### Technical Vulnerability Management
Vulnerabilities shall be identified, evaluated, and remediated in accordance with risk levels:

| Severity  | Remediation Time |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Critical  | 7 Days          |
| High      | 7 Days          |
| Medium    | 14 Days         |
| Low       | 30 Days         |
