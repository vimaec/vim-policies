# Physical Security Policy

**Policy Owner:** VIMBuild, LLC  
**Author:** Martin Ashton  
**Effective Date:** 02/06/2025

## Purpose
To prevent unauthorized physical access or damage to the organization's information and information processing facilities.

## Scope
This policy applies to all VIMBuild, LLC offices and locations. It also extends to all employees and external parties with physical access to VIMBuild, LLC owned or leased facilities.

## Policy

### Physical Security Perimeter
Physical offices and processing facilities shall meet all local building codes for construction materials for walls, windows, doors, and access control mechanisms. Some interior zones may be identified as secure areas where physical access is further restricted to a subset of VIMBuild, LLC personnel, such as private offices, wiring closets, print and server rooms, and server racks.

### Physical Entry Controls
Secure areas shall be protected by appropriate entry controls to ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed access. Where possible, VIMBuild, LLC access control systems shall be tied to a centralized system that provides granular access control for individual personnel. Access events shall be appropriately logged and reviewed as needed according to risk.

Cameras and intrusion detection systems shall be used at facilities that store or process production or sensitive internal company data.

### Securing Offices, Rooms & Facilities
Physical security for offices, rooms, and facilities shall be designed and applied to protect from theft, misuse, environmental threats, unauthorized access, and other threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of classified data and systems.

### Protecting Against External & Environmental Threats
Physical protection against natural disasters, malicious attacks, or accidents shall be designed and applied. Secure areas shall be monitored through the use of appropriate controls, such as intrusion detection systems, alarms, and/or video surveillance systems, where feasible. Visitor and third-party access to secure areas shall be restricted to reduce the risk of information loss and theft.

Production processing facilities shall be equipped with appropriate environmental and business continuity controls, including fire-suppression systems, climate control and monitoring systems, and emergency backup power systems. Physical information system hardware and supporting infrastructure shall be regularly serviced and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

### Working in Secure Areas / Visitor Management
Visitors, delivery personnel, outside support technicians, and other external agents shall not be permitted access to secure areas without escort and/or appropriate oversight. Third parties in secure areas shall sign in and out on a visitor log and shall be escorted or monitored by VIMBuild, LLC personnel. Personnel observing unescorted visitors should confirm their status and ensure they return to approved areas, or report the observation to the responsible authority as needed.

External party access to secure areas shall be confirmed with appropriate VIMBuild, LLC personnel prior to being granted access. Personnel providing access to external parties into secure areas are responsible for ensuring that they adhere to all security requirements and are accountable for all actions taken by those they provide with access.

Visitors may be allowed to work unescorted provided that the VIMBuild, LLC sponsoring party can ensure that they will not have unauthorized access to VIMBuild, LLC information systems, networks, or data.

### Delivery & Loading Areas
Access points such as delivery and loading areas, and other points where unauthorized persons could enter secure areas, shall be controlled and, if possible, isolated from information processing facilities to avoid unauthorized access.

### Supplier, Vendor, and Third-Party Security
Suppliers, vendors, and third parties shall comply with VIMBuild, LLC physical security and environmental control requirements. VIMBuild, LLC shall assess the adequacy of third-party physical security controls as part of the vendor management process, in accordance with the **[Third-Party Management Policy](./third_party_management_policy.md)**.
