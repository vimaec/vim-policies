Inadequate IT risk management exposes VIMBuild, LLC to security threats, cyberattacks, legal issues, and reputational damage. VIMBuild, LLC ensures that risk management is integral to organizational governance and business operations at strategic and operational levels.

## Risk Management Strategy
VIMBuild, LLC has established processes to identify and mitigate risks that could hinder the achievement of strategic and operational objectives. This strategy ensures that:
- The risk management policy is applied across the organization.
- The policy and its operational application are regularly reviewed.

## Risk Categories
VIMBuild, LLC classifies risks into the following categories:

- **Contractual**
- **Regulatory/Compliance**
- **Economic/Financial**
- **Fraud**
- **Privacy**
- **Environmental & Sustainability**
- **Impact on People**
- **Operational Capacity**

Each risk is assessed based on **likelihood** (scale of 1-5) and **impact** (scale of 1-5).

## Risk Criteria
Risk is determined by evaluating:
- Likelihood and impact of adverse events affecting confidentiality, availability, and integrity.
- Organizational and customer information security risks.
- Regulatory compliance risks related to privacy and data protection.

## Risk Response, Treatment, and Tracking
Risks are prioritized and maintained in a risk register. Risk responses include:
- **Modify:** Implement actions to reduce the risk.
- **Accept:** Monitor the risk while taking no immediate action.
- **Transfer:** Pass the risk to another party (e.g., insurance, contractual agreements).
- **Avoid:** Cease the activity or change processes to eliminate the risk.

Where applicable, a **Risk Treatment Plan** is developed for mitigation.

## Risk Management Procedures
1. Maintain a **Risk Register** and **Treatment Plan**.
2. Rank risks by likelihood and impact.
3. Evaluate risks to estimate potential monetary loss where possible.
4. Respond to risks based on priority and available resources.
